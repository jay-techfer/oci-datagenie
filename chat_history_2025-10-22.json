They are followed by **The** (38 hotels) and **Lemon** (26 hotels).\n\n2. **Mid-Range Groups**: Several hotel groups, such as **Vivanta** (25 hotels), **Gateway** (10 hotels), and **Trident** (8 hotels), have a moderate presence.\n\n3. **Smaller Groups**: Many hotel groups have only a few hotels, with counts ranging from 1 to 7. Examples include **Marriott**, **Holiday**, **Red** (each with 7 hotels), and numerous others with just 1 hotel.\n\n4. **Long Tail**: A significant portion of the dataset consists of hotel groups with only 1 hotel, indicating a large number of smaller or independent brands.\n\n5. **Total Hotels**: The dataset covers a wide range of hotel groups, from major chains to single-property brands, reflecting diversity in the hospitality industry.\n\nIn summary, the data highlights a concentration of hotels in a few major groups, with a long tail of smaller or independent brands."
