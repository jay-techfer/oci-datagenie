Since the provided dataset only includes hotel counts by group, we cannot directly calculate or predict prices. However, here\u2019s a logical approach based on typical predictive analysis:\n\n1. **Assumption**: If historical pricing data were available, we would analyze trends (e.g., higher prices during peak seasons, lower prices during off-peak periods).\n2. **Market Factors**: Consider external factors like local events, holidays, or economic conditions that could influence pricing.\n3. **Hotel Segmentation**: Luxury hotels (e.g., The Oberoi, Four Seasons) would likely have higher prices compared to mid-range hotels (e.g., Lemon Tree, Holiday Inn).\n\n**Prediction**: Without specific data, we cannot provide a numerical prediction. However, if historical data showed a 5% weekly increase in prices due to upcoming peak season, the daily average price might rise incrementally over the next 6 weeks. For example:\n- Week 1: $150  \n- Week 2: $157.50  \n- Week 3: $165.38  \n- Week 4: $173.65  \n- Week 5: $182.33  \n- Week 6: $191.45  \n\n**Recommendation**: For accurate predictions, gather historical pricing data, occupancy rates, and market trends."
